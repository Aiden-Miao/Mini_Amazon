1. [Problem] Users password may be exploited by malicious user
   [Fixed] Use User model from django Auth Library, which adopts hash and salt to preserve the users' passwords.

2. [Problem] One can look at others history orders.
   [Fixed] Add log-in-required before the history function in views.py. Same with track order. So that one cannot track the order that is not ordered by himself.

3. [Problem] When track some non-existent order id, the page would go wrong.
   [Fixed] by adding IF/ELSE code to check if the Order.objects.get() raises an exception.
